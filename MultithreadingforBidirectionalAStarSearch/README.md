  Multithreading for Bidirectional A* Search

This is a variant of the A Star Search algorithm 
New feature for the route-tracing application.

Given a second destination in the route planner, it improves the algorithm efficiency by running it simultaneously
with the use of threads forward and backward at the same time looking for these to intersect and, if not, returning
the lowest cost path
